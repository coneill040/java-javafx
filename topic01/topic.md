#The Setup

- Like most jobs you need the right tools to complete the job, programming is no different, you will need an application to write the javaFX code, you will also need something that visually allows you to see what the application your building looks like, and theres always a few other bits n' bobs aswell, all will be clearer in lab01 below.


- Lab01 will guide you through the process of downloading and installing the tools that you need, first of all you need the correct development enviornment, because we are developiong using JavaFX, which is a relativle new technology, we will need Java 8 installed, we will use the Eclipse editor to write the javFX code and we will use Scene Builder so that we can visualze the application.
