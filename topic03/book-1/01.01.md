##Start here 

- In Eclipse (with e(fx)clipse installed) go to _File | New | Other..._ and choose JavaFX Project.

- Remove the application package and its content if it was automatically created.

One very important principle is that of [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC). According to this we divide our code into three units and create a package for each (Right-click on the src-folder, _New... | Package):_
